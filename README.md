# Pytthon-Geolocator
Use to geolocate a bunch of addresses!

##Instructions##

You have to create a .CSV file with all the addresses you want to geolocate. Then replace the file's link in line 15 of the .py file.

Geolocator uses [Google Maps Api](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding) so you 'll have to get an API key and fill it in line 7 of the .py file.

Also you'll have to install googlemaps module.
Instructions: https://pypi.org/project/googlemaps/

Geolocator works on Chrome using chromedriver, so you have to download it: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started

**Important** Chromedriver must be in the same folder with the geolocator.py file **/Important**

That's all, enjoy!
