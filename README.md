# Pytthon-Geolocator
Use to geolocate a bunch of addresses

You have to create a .CSV file with all the addresses you want to geolocate. Then replace the file's link in line 15 of the .py file.

Geolocator uses Google Maps Api so you 'll have to get an API key and fill it in line 7 of the .py file
Here you have some info: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding

Also you'll have to install googlemaps module.
Instructions: https://pypi.org/project/googlemaps/

Geolocator works on Chrome using chromedriver, so you have to download it: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started

**Important** Chromedriver must be in the same folder with the geolocator.py file **/Important**

That's all, enjoy!
