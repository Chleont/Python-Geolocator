# Python-Geolocator
Use to geolocate a bunch of addresses!


## Instructions

* You have to create a .CSV file with all the addresses you want to geolocate. Then replace the file's link in line 15 of the .py file.

* Geolocator uses [Google Maps Api](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding) so you 'll have to get an API key and fill it in line 7 of the .py file.

* Also you'll have to install [googlemaps](https://pypi.org/project/googlemaps/).

* Geolocator works on Chrome using [chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started), so you have to download it.


**Important** Chromedriver must be in the same folder with the geolocator.py file **/Important**



That's all, enjoy!
